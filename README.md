### Must-have features

- first, you'll need an UI,  which is just a list of messages (there's two types of messages - those from the bots and those from the user) 
  and a text area with a _send_ button.
- Sending a message to the bot is done by clicking the _send_ button **or** typing `ENTER`.  
- on loading of the page, the bot welcomes the user with a random greeting message 
  (your bot needs _at least_ **three different** welcoming message), then, he ask the user _"how do you feel today?"_.
- The user can reply freely, and the bot need to check in the response if he can find a "yes" or a "no":
  - if the script find a "yes" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set (minimum **three different**) 
  - if the script find a "no" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set (minimum **three different**)
  - if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message, the bot answer something like "I didn't understand, can you please try again"
  - if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message after three attempts, the bot begins to be mad and use "passive-agressive" answer, like "dude, are you sure you can read?"
- After this answer, the bot has finish his routine. He says "bye" to the user and the textarea go to `disabled` mode.

### Bonus features

- support _multi-line_ messages: by typing `SHIFT+ENTER`, you create a new line in the textarea.
- add "in progress" animation and timeout to simulate "bot thinking"
- You can try to make the bot more "real" by having more possible answers to interact with the user.

### Steps
