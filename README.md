### Must-have features

- first, you'll need an UI,  which is just a list of messages (there's two types of messages - those from the bots and those from the user) 
  and a text area with a _send_ button.
- Sending a message to the bot is done by clicking the _send_ button **or** typing `ENTER`.  
- on loading of the page, the bot welcomes the user with a random greeting message 
  (your bot needs _at least_ **three different** welcoming message), then, he ask the user _"how do you feel today?"_.
- The user can reply freely, and the bot need to check in the response if he can find a "yes" or a "no":
  - if the script find a "yes" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set (minimum **three different**) 
  - if the script find a "no" in the message, the bot answers with a random sentence from a specific set (minimum **three different**)
  - if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message, the bot answer something like "I didn't understand, can you please try again"
  - if the script cannot find a "yes" or a "no" in the message after three attempts, the bot begins to be mad and use "passive-agressive" answer, like "dude, are you sure you can read?"
- After this answer, the bot has finish his routine. He says "bye" to the user and the textarea go to `disabled` mode.

### Bonus features

- support _multi-line_ messages: by typing `SHIFT+ENTER`, you create a new line in the textarea.
- add "in progress" animation and timeout to simulate "bot thinking"
- You can try to make the bot more "real" by having more possible answers to interact with the user.

## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
   - What, Why, When, How, Who.
   - Pending things to do
   - It must contain a link to the "live" version. The "live" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.
3. Publish the link to the "live" version on Discord.

### Steps

1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
4. UX Prototype ...

## Github Page for Source Code

# **The Mission**  

- Firsty, we worked on a simple page in HTML.  

    - You can see on this picture the first model of the bot :robot:
    -   ![Capture dâ€™Ã©cran de 2020-07-15 15-50-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62213192/87776480-1ed8e780-c828-11ea-81c0-0d0c39a33005.jpg)
        You can see on the right side of the picture the structure of the html, it's pretty simple.

We were not sure of the color we wanted to use. We decided that we wanted the page to be as simple as possible. So we finaly came up with the idea to use the theme of BeCode : dark blue & white.
    - 

Once the theme was set up, we decided to begin our JavaScript. It was by far the hardest part... We searched so much on the internet to find a template or a tutorial that will help us to start the project.  

We finally decided to work as a team and start from scratch. And we are happy with the results that correspond exactly to the requirements.
